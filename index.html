        <h1>How I Started Playing Video Games</h1>
        <p>My first console was a Nintendo 64 which I shared with my older sister and our favorite game to play was 007
            Golden Eye. My next console was playstation 2, then in 2007 the release of Halo 3 lead me to getting my
            first xbox 360 with live service. Video games hold fond memories for me playing them with friends and my
            family. More than that I enjoyed the visual storytelling elements mixed with the ability to actually
            participate in it. Besides the main video game consoles I also enjoyed playing Pokemon on my gameboy during
            long
            drives to my grandparents house. </p>
        <h2>On the navigation bar are some of my favorite games.</h2>
        <p>I will give a brief description of each of them.</p>
